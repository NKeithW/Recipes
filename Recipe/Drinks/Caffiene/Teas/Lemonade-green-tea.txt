When making different lemonades you can add 1oz of green tea to it in an 8oz drink to make it have the benifits of green tea and the teas after taste. Can be done in normal lemonade or custom ones like strawberry lemonade or even strawberry dragonfruit. I really enjoyed it in the strawberry and raspberry lemonade.
