Take an 8oz mason jar and pour lemonade (I prefer homeade with pulp.) up to the bottom curve or buble thing. Then add one ice cube. I prefer using an expresso brew but any dark brew works. Hot or cold ones work as well. After filling the jar rest of the way up add sugar to your liking. I reccomend tasting it first cause the lemonade does counter the bitterness of the coffee some so you need less sugar than a normal black coffee.
